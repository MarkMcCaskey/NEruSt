NES emulator.  Back from the dead!  (for real this time)

High level TODO list:
- [ ] Come up with a better name!
- [ ] CPU emulation!
  - [ ] Figure out what our current status is!
- [ ] Emulate 1 type of cartridge!
- [ ] Draw something!
- [ ] Play some sound!
- [ ] Handle some input!
- [ ] Make the emulator nice to use once it's working (i.e. configuration, Wasm support, GUI).
